# Minitrice

## Presentation

### Context
University python project. The minitrice performs basic operations from command line. 

It can be used interactively in a terminal, but also coupled with other programs to send data through a pipe. Test files of example expressions as well as an expression generator are provided in this repository.

### Example of use

- Interactive usage
```bash
1. $ ./minitrice
2. > 3+9
3. 12
4. > 
5. Fin des calculs :)
6. $ echo $?
7. 0
8. $ 
```

- Usage with cat
```bash
 1. $ cat good-expression.txt | ./minitrice
 2. 4
 3. 11
 4. 35
 5. -4
 6. 12
 8. 90
 9. 4.0
10. 8.0
11. 10
12. 4
13. $ echo $?
14. 0
15. $ 
```

- Usage with an expression generator
```bash
1. $ ./generator 2 | ./minitrice
2. -2
3. 7.0

```

## Installation

### Install dependencies
- Linux environement
This project is intended to operate within a Linux environment. If you are under Windows, you may wan to install WSL2 to access a linx terminal and run the program. ([See here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) for VSCode)

- Python, v3.9.9
You will also need the Python programming language installed. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/)

### Steps 
- Download the project using the following command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulinebrisset/minitrice
``` 
- Then go in the new folder
```bash
cd minitrice
``` 
- Set the executable permissions on the files
```bash
chmod +x generator
``` 
Without setting this permission, the files would not be recognized as executable scripts, and you would need to call them with `python3 generator.py 3` instead of `./generator.py 3`.
